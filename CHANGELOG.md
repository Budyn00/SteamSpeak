> Less bugs, multi game plugins, faster documentation. I almost forgot, SteamSpeak now supports CS:GO integration ðŸ‘¾
</div>
<details><summary>Upgrade guide</summary>
<p>

### Breaking changes:
#### Plugins
- Afk kick
	- Changed plugin interval from "seconds: 5" to "seconds: 10"
	- Changed kick interval from "seconds: 5" to "minutes: 30"
- Afk move
	 -	Changed plugin interval from "seconds: 5" to "seconds: 10"
	 -	Changed move interval from "seconds: 5" to "minutes: 20"
- Change channel
	- Now it's disabled by default
	- Replaced config data changes keys. From channel_name to channelName & channel_description to channelDescription
	- Changed plugin interval from "seconds: 3" to "seconds: 5"
- Multi function
	- Changed plugin interval from "seconds: 5" to "minutes: 5"
#### Database
- verified client (NOTE: You'll need to update your database manually)
	- Changed dbid type from number to string.
	- Changed groupId type from number to string.

### Notes:
#### Steam Modules
 - rich presence
	- Now SteamSpeak uses Regex to filter steamGroups. The used regex is: https://regex101.com/r/TexROh/1
	IMPORTANT: Now groups (only if the group's type is query and namemode is set to 2) that contains "*#[number] [rich presence]*" are considered SteamSpeak groups. This means that you should not create a group with the same pattern and same properties to prevent SteamSpeak deleting them. This is done to prevent group duplication bug.
