## Reporting a Vulnerability

We deeply appreciate any effort to discover and disclose security
vulnerabilities responsibly.

If you would like to report a vulnerability or have any security concerns with
SteamSpeak, please e-mail eldalexhd@gmail.com

For non-critical matters, we prefer users [open an issue][urls.new_security_report].
For us to best investigate your request, please include any of the
following when reporting:

* Proof of concept
* Any tools, including versions used
* Any relevant output

We take all disclosures very seriously and will do our best to rapidly respond
and verify the vulnerability before taking the necessary steps to fix it. After
our initial reply to your disclosure, which should be directly after receiving
it, we will periodically update you with the status of the fix.
